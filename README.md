# Interactive Excel Dashboard  

I put together a sales report using Python and Pandas to analyze and visualize data. The dashboard is fully interactive, thanks to **Plotly.go**, making it easy to explore insights.  

I also pulled in data from different sources to get a complete picture, cleaned everything up using Pandas, and made sure the insights are clear and useful for improving sales strategies.
